This is an introductory course to Generative Grammar, in film noir style!

Now a quote from the forword of the handout:

> One of the most encouraging aspects of the current educational scene is the great wave of reform that is affecting the teaching of the major academic subjects in the school curriculum. Beginning several years ago with science, mathematics, and (a little later) foreign language, this movement has now brought about radical changes in the content of these subjects and in the method of presenting them to school children. Underlying the changes have been not only a major shift in educational philosophy--away from so-called "life-adjustment," toward greater intellectual rigor--but also a conscious effort to bring the curriculum into line with the present state of scholarly knowledge in the various disciplines.
